# Investigate No-show Appointments Dataset
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.
In our investigation we will answer the following questions in order to determine if some factors affect whether or not a patient will make it to his appointment:

- Does age affect whether the patient attends or not?
- Are no-shows more common for specific gender?
- Are no-shows more common in patients with a certain disease?
- Does sending sms messages result in fewer No-shows?
